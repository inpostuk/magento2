InPost has a national network of nearly 1,200 fully automated parcel lockers that are accessible 24/7, meaning no more queues or waiting in, enabling customers to collect, send and return parcels at their earliest convenience. All lockers are located in a variety of safe and secure locations including Morrisons supermarkets, Esso petrol stations and Transport for London sites, as well as outside retailers such as Toys R Us.

This Magento 2 module implements InPost Locker service allowing visitors to send their parcels to their locker of choice nearby.

With this extension, new shipping method is added where customer will be able to navigate lockers in their area and select the most convenient. Locker information is stored within customer order and is communicated to InPost via API during fullfillment and shipping process. Customers are able to track progress of their parcel from within ‘My Account’ area. Problematic parcels are reflected within admin system messages so your Customer Service can communicate and process these orders accordingly.
